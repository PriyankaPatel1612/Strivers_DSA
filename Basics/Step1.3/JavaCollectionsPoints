#Collection

Any group of individual objects that are represented as a single unit is known as a Java Collection of Objects.

A separate framework named the “Collection Framework” has been defined in JDK 1.2 which holds all the Java Collection Classes and Interface in it. 

In Java, the Collection interface (java.util.Collection) and Map interface (java.util.Map) are the two main “root” interfaces of Java collection classes.

#Methods of Collections Interface

add(Object) -- add an object to collection

addAll(Collection c) -- adds all the elements in given collection to this collection

clear() -- removes  all elements from Collections.

containsAll(Object o) -- returns true if collection contains the specified elements.

containsAll(Collection c) -- returns true if collection contains all element in given collection.

equals(Object o) --   compares the specified object with this collection for equality.

hashCode() -- return to use the hashcode value for this collection.

isEmpty() -- returns true if this collection contains no element.

iterator() -- returns an iterator over the elements in collection.

max() -- used to return the maximum value present in collection.

parallelStream() -- method returns a parallel stream with this colllection as its source.

remove(Object o) -- used to remove the given object from collection, if there is duplicate then this method remove first occurence.

removeAll(Collection c) -- used to remove all the objects mentioned in given collection from collection.

removeelf(Predicate filter) -- used to remove all the elements of this collection that satisfy given predicate.

retainAll(Collection c) -- used to retain only elements in this collection that are contained in specified collection.

size() -- used to return number of elements in the collection.

spliterator() -- used to create spliterator over the elements in this collection.

stream() -- used to return a sequential stream with this collection as its source.

toArray() -- used to return array containing all the elements in this collection.
