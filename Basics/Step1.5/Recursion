Recursion-
    -->when a function calls itself.
    -->until a specified condition is fulfilled.

Base Condition-
    -->It is the condition that is written in a 
    recursive function in order for it to get 
    completed and not to run infinitely.
    -->he function terminates and returns back 
    to its parent function simultaneously.

Stack Overflow / Stack Space-
    -->when there is no base condition given for 
    a particular recursive function, it gets 
    called indefinitely which results in a Stack 
    Overflow i.e, exceeding the memory limit of 
    the recursion stack and hence the program 
    terminates giving a Segmentation Fault 
    error. 

Recursion Tree-
    -->A recursive tree is basically a representative form of recursion which depicts how functions are called and returned as a series of events happening consecutively.
    -->It is a pictorial description of the process of recursion.
